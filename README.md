# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis I'll be supporting Bobby ahead of the "*Silver Tsunami*", in order to prepare a work force that is ready once the expected number of employees retire.
To further our analysis, we'll be performing data retrieval steps in order to develop new tables that specificy the departments that need help. 
First, we'll retrieve the number of retiring employees by title and then perform an analysis of the results. Second, we'll retrieve a list of the employees eligible for the mentorship program.
This should help narrow down what positions most retiring employees are leaving behind, and which of these employees are eligible for the mentorship program to help transition new employees into their roles. 

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed

The first deliverable evaluates the number of retiring employees by title as shown in Image 1 below.

## Summary

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
